## Custom Kernels for All from Codex and Claude
- **URL:** https://huggingface.co/blog/custom-cuda-kernels-agent-skills
- **Published:** 2026-02-13
- **Description:** Announces a new agent skill that enables AI coding agents (Claude, Codex, and others) to automatically generate production-ready CUDA kernels with PyTorch bindings and benchmarks. Demonstrates real-world performance improvements including 1.88x speedup on LTX-Video and 1.94x on Qwen3-8B.
- **Relevance:** Directly relevant to agentic patterns, AI coding assistants, and Claude capabilities. Shows how agents can autonomously develop optimized GPU kernels with measurable performance improvements.

## OpenEnv in Practice: Evaluating Tool-Using Agents in Real-World Environments
- **URL:** https://huggingface.co/blog/openenv-turing
- **Published:** 2026-02-12
- **Description:** Introduces OpenEnv, an open-source framework for evaluating AI agents in real-world environments rather than simulations. Presents the Calendar Gym benchmark and reveals critical bottlenecks in tool-using agents, including multi-step reasoning challenges, ambiguity handling, and argument validation.
- **Relevance:** Directly relevant to agentic patterns and tool use. Provides research insights into agent evaluation methodologies and identifies key failure modes that are crucial for building reliable tool-using agents.
