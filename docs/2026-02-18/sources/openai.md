## Summary

No articles matching the filter criteria (published on or after 2026-02-17) were found on the OpenAI news page at the time of scanning.

The most recent articles available on the page are from February 13, 2026:
- GPT-5.2 derives a new result in theoretical physics (Research)
- Introducing Lockdown Mode and Elevated Risk labels in ChatGPT (Safety)
- Scaling social science research (Global Affairs)
- Beyond rate limits: scaling access to Codex and Sora (Engineering)

These articles, while highly relevant to the topic (LLM capabilities, agentic patterns, and coding assistants), fall outside the specified date range and are therefore not included in this report.

### Note on Relevance

If the date filter were to be relaxed, the articles from February 13-12 would be highly relevant:
- **GPT-5.2 theoretical physics result**: Demonstrates frontier LLM reasoning capabilities on complex scientific problems
- **Lockdown Mode for ChatGPT**: Safety features for AI tool usage
- **Beyond rate limits (Codex and Sora)**: Engineering infrastructure for scaling AI coding and media generation tools
- **Harness engineering (Codex agent-first world)**: Directly relevant to agentic patterns and tool integration
- **Introducing GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark**: Product release for coding assistance

All of these align with the research topic on LLMs, agentic patterns, AI tools, and coding assistants.
