- **Published:** 2026-02-18
- **Description:** Google has integrated Lyria 3, its music generation model, into the Gemini app, enabling users to create custom, high-quality 30-second tracks from text and images. This expands Gemini's multimodal capabilities beyond text and images into audio generation.
- **Relevance:** Demonstrates the evolution of AI assistants toward integrated multimodal platforms, showing how LLM-based tools like Gemini are consolidating diverse generative capabilities (text, image, audio) into unified interfaces—key trends in modern AI tool development.
