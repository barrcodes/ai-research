## Overview

Sequoia Capital partners Pat Grady and Sonya Huang argue that Artificial General Intelligence has functionally arrived—not as a theoretical construct, but as practical capability. Their case: long-horizon agents capable of autonomous, multi-step work over extended periods now reliably execute tasks that previously required human domain expertise. This represents the completion of a three-layer foundation laid since 2022.

## Key Points

- **Functional AGI Definition**: Capabilities that "figure things out" autonomously—distinct from philosophical definitions. AGI = knowledge (pre-training) + reasoning (inference compute) + iteration (agent loops).

- **Three-Layer Architecture**: Knowledge foundations (ChatGPT, 2022) → reasoning-focused models (o1 series, late 2024) → autonomous agents with planning, tool use, memory, state management, and error correction (early 2026).

- **Exponential Progress Trajectory**: METR's data shows capability doubling every ~7 months. Current agents handle 30-minute tasks; projection suggests full-day expert work by 2028, full-year tasks by 2034.

- **Evidence is Practical**: Specialized agents across medicine (OpenEvidence), law (Harvey), cybersecurity (XBOW) already operating autonomously. The hiring litmus test: "Can you employ this agent?"

## Technical Details

Agent architecture emphasizes scaffolding solutions over pure RL approaches:

- **Reinforcement Learning Path**: Models learn intrinsically to maintain focus during training (research labs)
- **Agent Harness Path**: Structured framework addressing known limitations—memory hand-offs, context compaction, error recovery loops (production application layer)

Current capability ceiling: agents autonomously form hypotheses, iterate independently, backtrack from dead ends, fix mistakes without human intervention. Daily utility shift from "few interactions per day" to "all-day continuous operation with parallel instances."

The breakthrough's timing (late 2025/early 2026) correlates with agents gaining tool integration, state persistence, and multi-attempt loops—moving beyond conversation toward agentic work patterns.

## Implications

**Architecture Decision Point**: This framing redefines AGI from a theoretical threshold to a practical capability classification. For practitioners, it means:

1. **Hiring Decisions**: Specialized agent deployment becomes a viable workforce layer—competitive advantage shifts to organizations that effectively integrate agents into existing teams and workflows.

2. **Scaling Vector**: Rather than pursuing theoretical "general" intelligence, the winning path is vertical specialization (domain agents) paired with horizontal expansion (parallel instances, extended context windows, tool ecosystems).

3. **Benchmarking Shift**: Capability measurement moves from benchmark scores to production task completion rate and duration. The relevant metric is "what task complexity can this agent autonomously execute start-to-finish?"

4. **Risk**: Exponential capability growth (7-month doubling) creates deployment timeline compression. Organizations face pressure to adopt agent infrastructure before competitive moats solidify.

**Alternative Perspective**: This pragmatic definition sidesteps debates about consciousness and true generality by measuring economic utility. The counterargument: functional capability without reasoning or self-directed goal formation may be narrow intelligence at scale, not genuine AGI.
