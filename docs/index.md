Weekly catchup covering Feb 23–27: Government AI showdown dominates — OpenAI gains classified DoW deployment while Anthropic faces supply-chain designation after rejecting Pentagon safeguard-removal demands, then contests the ruling in court. Karpathy declares a December 2025 inflection where coding agents crossed from barely functional to genuinely autonomous 30-minute tasks. Anthropic acquires Vercept (OSWorld jumps 15%→72.5%); Qwen3.5 releases 122B-A10B and 35B-A3B MoE variants with strong agentic coding benchmarks. OpenAI raises $110B at $730B valuation; Meta commits $100B to AMD chips. Security: invisible Unicode prompt injection achieves 71% compliance with tools enabled; ContextCache delivers 29x TTFT speedup for tool-calling agents. RSP v3.0 and Anthropic's COBOL tool (IBM stock −10%) round out a dense week. 41 articles researched across 11 themes.

Anthropic safety governance dominates: Pentagon threatens to cancel a $200M contract unless Anthropic removes autonomous weapons safeguards—the same week Anthropic dropped its binding RSP safety pledge in favor of discretionary disclosure. Diffusion-based LLMs arrive as a credible architectural alternative: Mercury 2 achieves 1,000 tokens/sec (10x faster than Haiku) while LLaDA solves the reversal curse via bidirectional generation. Security vulnerabilities compound: prefill attacks achieve near-100% success across all 50 tested open-weight LLMs with zero protection from scale, while LLM deanonymization achieves 68% recall at 90% precision across platforms. MCP ecosystem analysis of 1,400+ servers reveals 232% growth but 38.7% lack authentication. Qwen3.5 (35B-A3B MoE) outperforms GPT-5-mini on agentic coding benchmarks while Chinese models now command 61% of OpenRouter token volume at 10-20x lower cost. Claude Code Remote Control, Emdash, and Excalidraw integration round out strong agentic tooling developments. 20 articles researched across 7 themes.

### [2026-02-24](./2026-02-24/index.md)

Anthropic discloses three coordinated distillation campaigns (16M+ exchanges, 24K fraudulent accounts) by DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax targeting chain-of-thought and tool orchestration patterns—the first public industrial-scale capability extraction disclosure. Production agent threat analysis (91K interactions) shows tool-chain escalation doubling to 11.7% of all attacks, making orchestration-layer security mandatory. Model efficiency reshapes the competitive landscape: Qwen 3.5 (35B-397B MoE, 60% cost reduction), Mercury 2 (diffusion-based reasoning, 11x throughput), and Kimi K2.5 (parallel-agent RL, 3-4.5x speedup) challenge frontier model economics. OpenAI retires SWE-bench Verified after finding 59.4% test case flaws and widespread training contamination across all frontier models. Agentic coding demos (Z80 emulator, Blender tutorial, Kanban dev pipeline) converge on a single finding: specification quality gates autonomous execution capability. 16 articles researched across 5 themes.

### [2026-02-23](./2026-02-23/index.md)

Local inference consolidation arrives: GGML/llama.cpp joining Hugging Face automates the transformers→quantized-model pipeline, making local deployment trivial without quantization expertise. Claude Code Security shifts vulnerability detection from signature-matching to semantic reasoning—500+ previously undetected vulnerabilities found in mature codebases, restricted to Enterprise/Team. Agentic tooling matures on two fronts: AgentDbg brings local-first debugging with decorator-based instrumentation for agent execution traces, while BVisor delivers 2ms sandboxed bash execution (vs 100ms+ containers) for safe ephemeral tool calls. Simon Willison frames the economic inversion—code generation cost near zero shifts engineering from authoring to architectural governance of higher code volatility. Personal Vault implements scoped-token MCP context management; OmniGlass delivers user-directed sandboxed visual automation. OpenAI's First Proof initiative validates frontier model reasoning on formal mathematics with human-guided verification loops. 10 articles researched across 6 themes.
