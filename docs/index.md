Frontier models solidify agentic orchestration: Claude Opus 4.6's agent teams enable parallel multi-agent workflows natively, while SAE steering limitations clarify that structured output requires constrained decoding—not semantic control. AIRS-Bench emerges as the first genuine autonomy benchmark, measuring end-to-end research lifecycle capability (4/20 tasks solved across frontier models). Security surfaces proliferate: prompt injection in messaging apps exploits automatic URL preview to exfiltrate agent data; enterprise agent deployments show 58% visibility but only 37% actual control—a critical governance-containment gap. Terminology crisis around "async agents" exposes definitional fragmentation across orchestration models. Sparse MoE models (Qwen3, Step-3.5-Flash, GLM-5, LLaDA2.0) compress toward frontier capability with 6-10x efficiency gains via active-parameter optimization. Video synthesis quality reaches 95-98% accuracy (MOS 3.5-4.2) but full-deepfake detectability remains, limiting high-assurance applications. Medical AI benchmarks decouple from real-world performance (94% exam scores → 33% diagnostic accuracy), highlighting verification bottleneck. Local LLM deployment economics improve with linear attention (Kimi-Linear-48B) achieving 6x throughput on million-token contexts. 10 sources, 44 articles identified, 28 researched.
