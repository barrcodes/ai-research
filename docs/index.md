Local inference consolidation arrives: GGML/llama.cpp joining Hugging Face automates the transformers→quantized-model pipeline, making local deployment trivial without quantization expertise. Claude Code Security shifts vulnerability detection from signature-matching to semantic reasoning—500+ previously undetected vulnerabilities found in mature codebases, restricted to Enterprise/Team. Agentic tooling matures on two fronts: AgentDbg brings local-first debugging with decorator-based instrumentation for agent execution traces, while BVisor delivers 2ms sandboxed bash execution (vs 100ms+ containers) for safe ephemeral tool calls. Simon Willison frames the economic inversion—code generation cost near zero shifts engineering from authoring to architectural governance of higher code volatility. Personal Vault implements scoped-token MCP context management; OmniGlass delivers user-directed sandboxed visual automation. OpenAI's First Proof initiative validates frontier model reasoning on formal mathematics with human-guided verification loops. 10 articles researched across 6 themes.
