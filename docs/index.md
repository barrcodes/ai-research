Anthropic discloses three coordinated distillation campaigns (16M+ exchanges, 24K fraudulent accounts) by DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax targeting chain-of-thought and tool orchestration patterns—the first public industrial-scale capability extraction disclosure. Production agent threat analysis (91K interactions) shows tool-chain escalation doubling to 11.7% of all attacks, making orchestration-layer security mandatory. Model efficiency reshapes the competitive landscape: Qwen 3.5 (35B-397B MoE, 60% cost reduction), Mercury 2 (diffusion-based reasoning, 11x throughput), and Kimi K2.5 (parallel-agent RL, 3-4.5x speedup) challenge frontier model economics. OpenAI retires SWE-bench Verified after finding 59.4% test case flaws and widespread training contamination across all frontier models. Agentic coding demos (Z80 emulator, Blender tutorial, Kanban dev pipeline) converge on a single finding: specification quality gates autonomous execution capability. 16 articles researched across 5 themes.

Local inference consolidation arrives: GGML/llama.cpp joining Hugging Face automates the transformers→quantized-model pipeline, making local deployment trivial without quantization expertise. Claude Code Security shifts vulnerability detection from signature-matching to semantic reasoning—500+ previously undetected vulnerabilities found in mature codebases, restricted to Enterprise/Team. Agentic tooling matures on two fronts: AgentDbg brings local-first debugging with decorator-based instrumentation for agent execution traces, while BVisor delivers 2ms sandboxed bash execution (vs 100ms+ containers) for safe ephemeral tool calls. Simon Willison frames the economic inversion—code generation cost near zero shifts engineering from authoring to architectural governance of higher code volatility. Personal Vault implements scoped-token MCP context management; OmniGlass delivers user-directed sandboxed visual automation. OpenAI's First Proof initiative validates frontier model reasoning on formal mathematics with human-guided verification loops. 10 articles researched across 6 themes.
