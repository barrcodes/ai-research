Attention mechanism fragmentation: Qwen3.5's hybrid linear-full attention shows scaffolding strategy (prompt engineering, context management) drives 9-point agentic gains over pure architectural choices. Parameter efficiency displaces scaling: MiniCPM-o 4.5 (9B) matches Gemini 2.5 Flash via architecture innovation; TinyAya (3.35B) achieves multilingual SOTA through tokenization rather than compute; FunctionGemma 270M reaches 90-97% tool-calling accuracy via targeted fine-tuning. Multi-agent verification emerges as hallucination solution: Grok 4.20's 4-agent peer review (12.11% trading returns vs. all competitors losing) proves disagreement-driven validation outperforms single-model chains. DeepMind's delegation framework identifies MCP policy layer gap; contract-first protocols with cryptographic enforcement replace heuristic orchestration. Memory architecture becomes requirement: Project Orchestrator's Neo4j + MCP + semantic search addresses statelessness at scale; Claude-engram's salience-decay-consolidation model outperforms append-only logs. Security governance decouples from capabilities: Rulebricks policy engine and OpenAI Lockdown Mode enable autonomy + auditability through external policy layers. Pentagon-Anthropic dispute (July 11 deadline) may fragment AI ecosystem via supply chain risk designation. Genuine scientific contribution validated: GPT-5.2 derived novel gluon scattering formula (compression → pattern recognition → proof workflow). Remote Labor Index reveals 3.75% success rate ceiling—current agents bottlenecked by planning/error-recovery architecture, not raw reasoning. Regional optimization becomes moat: Anthropic's India deployment (second-largest revenue), TinyAya variants, MiniCPM-o training prioritize localization over English-dominant scaling. 11 sources, 21 articles researched.
