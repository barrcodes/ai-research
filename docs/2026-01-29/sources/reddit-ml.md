## AlphaGenome: DeepMind's unified DNA sequence model
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/
- published: 2026-01-29
- description: DeepMind's AlphaGenome model predicts regulatory variant effects across 11 modalities at single-bp resolution. Uses U-Net backbone with CNN + transformer layers, trained on human and mouse genomes with inference under 1 second on H100.
- relevance: Demonstrates advanced transformer architecture for sequence modeling, relevant to understanding how foundation models can be applied to biological domains.

## Knowledge Graphs are Implicit Reward Models: Path-Derived Signals Enable Compositional Reasoning
- url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15160
- published: 2026-01-29
- description: Research on using knowledge graphs as scalable reward models to enable compositional reasoning in LLMs. Shows a 14B model trained on short 1-3 hop paths generalizing to unseen 4-5 hop questions and outperforming GPT 5.2 on compositional tasks.
- relevance: Directly addresses agentic reasoning patterns, reward design for RL-on-LLMs, and compositional problem solving—core topics in advancing LLM capabilities.

## ICML submission policy type discussion on LLM use in reviewing
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/
- published: 2026-01-29
- description: Discussion of ICML 2026's two-policy framework for LLM use in peer review, comparing conservative (prohibited) vs permissive (limited) approaches.
- relevance: Relevant to AI governance and the implications of LLM deployment in scientific processes.

## Lessons learned when trying to rely on G-CTR-style guarantees in practice
- url: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05887
- published: 2026-01-29
- description: Research examining how static guarantees in AI systems can fail in practice, discovering adaptive failure modes not caught by benchmarks.
- relevance: Addresses critical evaluation and safety considerations for deploying LLMs and AI systems in non-iid conditions.

## LAD-A2A: How AI agents find each other on local networks
- url: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/
- published: 2026-01-28
- description: Open-source discovery protocol (Apache 2.0) that enables AI agents to find and communicate with each other on local networks using mDNS or HTTP endpoints, complementing Google's A2A agent-to-agent protocol and MCP tool-use standard.
- relevance: Directly relevant to agentic patterns and multi-agent system architectures, addressing the practical challenge of agent discovery and coordination.
