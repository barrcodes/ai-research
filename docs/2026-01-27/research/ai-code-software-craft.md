# AI Code and Software Craft

## Overview

The essay argues that AI code generation succeeds precisely because the software industry has already abandoned craftsmanship in favor of optimization metrics. Rather than fixing poor software, AI accelerates the production of mediocre systems—exposing a fundamental structural problem in how large tech companies develop software at scale. The author reframes this not as failure but as opportunity for intentional craftsmanship on the margins.

## Key Points

- **Technique dominates craft**: Modern software development optimizes for measured efficiency, not quality. This creates conditions where AI thrives because AI excels at statistical optimization—the same orientation that now drives the industry.

- **AI's actual boundary**: AI handles well-defined tasks competently (unit tests, boilerplate, database functions) but fails at problems requiring architectural judgment and understanding consequences. It "will lie to you, they don't really understand things, and they often generate bad code."

- **The real problem isn't tooling**: Enterprise software is poor because large tech companies operate as "non-competitive monopolies" where engineers work narrow roles disconnected from technical skill development. AI acceleration doesn't address this—it masks it.

- **Craft becomes valuable**: As commodity software production accelerates via AI, space emerges for human-scale, intentionally-crafted systems. Scarcity creates value—the inverse of the open-source commoditization curve.

## Technical Details

The author invokes Jacques Ellul's "technique"—reducing any activity to efficient means toward measurable ends. Two examples illustrate the impact:

| System | Orientation | Outcome |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Bandcamp | Curator judgment | High-quality indie music discovery |
| Spotify | Algorithmic optimization | "Bland, algorithmically-targeted muzak" |

AI output reflects similar constraints: verbose, flat design sensibilities, patterns optimized for statistical likelihood rather than actual problem requirements.

## Implications

**For practitioners:**
- AI code works as industrial scaffolding—embrace it for well-defined, non-critical paths
- Where judgment matters (architecture, trade-offs, understanding constraints), AI remains a liability, not an accelerant
- The distinction: "Craft isn't aesthetic—it's having developed judgment for which corners you can't cut"

**Strategic consideration:**
As AI commoditizes mainstream software, competitive advantage shifts to systems built with intentional constraints and real understanding. Organizations optimizing for pure velocity will struggle with unmaintainable systems; those preserving craft practices win on resilience and adaptability.

The essay suggests this is not a temporary gap but a permanent structural opportunity—the technology industry has optimized itself into terrain where AI excels and human judgment becomes scarce, hence valuable.
