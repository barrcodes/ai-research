## [P] I built a free ML practice platform - would love your feedback
- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/[MLPractice-thread]/
- **Published:** 2026-02-04
- **Description:** Neural Forge - a free ML practice platform with 73 questions across all ML topics, browser-based Python coding via Pyodide, spaced repetition, and 8 question types. Built largely using Kimi Code.
- **Relevance:** Demonstrates AI coding assistant applications (Kimi Code used for ~99% of implementation) and practical ML learning tools.

## [P] I built an Open-Source Ensemble for Fast, Calibrated Prompt Injection Detection
- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/[PromptForest-thread]/
- **Published:** 2026-02-04
- **Description:** PromptForest - an open-source system detecting prompt injections in LLMs using weighted ensemble methods. Achieves competitive accuracy with smaller model size (~237M vs ~600M parameters) and better calibration.
- **Relevance:** LLM security and safety tools, demonstrating practical ensemble methods for protecting language models from adversarial prompts.

## [D] OpenClaw can't automate half the things I want in an automation
- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/[OpenClaw-thread]/
- **Published:** 2026-02-04
- **Description:** Discussion on UI-based automation agents versus API-based approaches, arguing UI agents will win because they operate at the one layer products cannot hide. Features demo of OpenClaw operating Android devices autonomously.
- **Relevance:** Agentic patterns and autonomous agent systems - exploring the future of UI-driven AI agents as primary automation mechanism.

## [D] Looking for LOI
- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/[LOI-thread]/
- **Published:** 2026-02-04
- **Description:** Seeking partnerships with inference providers for a proprietary LLM optimization plugin achieving 2.5-3.5x throughput improvement over standard vLLM with maintained latency SLAs.
- **Relevance:** LLM inference optimization and deployment infrastructure - relevant to AI infrastructure and serving challenges.

## [R] Better alternatives to CatBoost for credit risk explainability (not LightGBM)?
- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/[CatBoost-thread]/
- **Published:** 2026-02-04
- **Description:** Research discussion on explainability and alternative models for credit risk prediction with tabular data, seeking options beyond CatBoost for improved interpretability.
- **Relevance:** ML explainability and model interpretability - related to building trustworthy AI systems with better model transparency.
