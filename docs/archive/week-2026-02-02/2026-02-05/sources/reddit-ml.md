## [P] CRAFT: thinking agent for image generation and edit

- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qwhkcg/p_craft_thinking_agent_for_image_generation_and/
- **Published:** 2026-02-05
- **Description:** CRAFT is a training-free, model-agnostic agentic reasoning layer for image generation and editing. It decomposes prompts into explicit visual constraints, generates images, verifies constraints with a VLM, and applies targeted edits only where constraints fail, iterating with explicit stopping conditions. Demonstrates improved compositional accuracy across multiple models (FLUX, Qwen-Image, Z-Image-Turbo).
- **Relevance:** Directly relevant to agentic patterns and AI tools. Demonstrates LLM/VLM-based reasoning loops and agent-like verification systems for image generation workflows.

## [P] NTTuner - GUI to Locally Fine-Tune AI Models with Unsloth GPU + CPU Support

- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qwbc9d/p_nttuner_gui_to_locally_finetune_ai_models_with/
- **Published:** 2026-02-05
- **Description:** NTTuner is a desktop GUI application for end-to-end LoRA fine-tuning workflow including GPU acceleration via Unsloth, automatic GGUF conversion, and direct Ollama integration. Includes NTCompanion, a dataset builder tool for web scraping and dataset creation. Supports local LLM fine-tuning and deployment with drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Relevance:** Highly relevant to AI tools and infrastructure. Addresses local LLM deployment, fine-tuning automation, and tooling for machine learning workflows.

## [D] Some ACL 2025 papers not indexed by Google Scholar

- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qwazn3/d_some_acl_2025_papers_not_indexed_by_google/
- **Published:** 2026-02-05
- **Description:** Discussion about ACL 2025 papers not appearing in Google Scholar search results. User reports that their arXiv version is indexed but the ACL proceedings version is not, with references to other papers with the same issue.
- **Relevance:** Tangentially relevant. While about publication indexing rather than LLM/agent research, ACL is a premier AI conference and the discussion relates to academic AI research discovery.

## [R] IDA PhD Forum CfP (deadline Feb 23), get feedback and mentorship on your research

- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qwi1ei/r_ida_phd_forum_cfp_deadline_feb_23_get_feedback/
- **Published:** 2026-02-05
- **Description:** Call for papers for the 2026 IDA PhD Forum, a mentorship program connecting PhD students with senior researchers in Intelligent Data Analysis. Conference dates April 22-24, 2026 in Leiden, Netherlands. Submission deadline February 23, 2026.
- **Relevance:** Moderately relevant. IDA covers intelligent data analysis and AI/ML research, but the post is primarily about a conference CfP rather than specific research advances.

## [D] How to structure an RL solution for a forecasting problem combined with supervised learning

- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qwbykz/d_how_to_structure_an_rl_solution_for_a/
- **Published:** 2026-02-05
- **Description:** Discussion post asking about how to structure reinforcement learning on top of supervised model predictions for sales forecasting. User is exploring whether RL, offline bandits, or residual correction frameworks would be appropriate for their tabular historical data.
- **Relevance:** Relevant to ML techniques and agent patterns. Explores the application of RL and agentic decision-making to forecasting problems.

## [R] External validation keeps killing my ML models (lab-generated vs external lab data)

- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qwbb6v/r_external_validation_keeps_killing_my_ml_models/
- **Published:** 2026-02-05
- **Description:** Researcher posting about severe performance drops when validating ML/DL models on external lab data. Strong internal validation (85%+) but cross-subject validation drops to 65-70%. Discusses domain shift, batch effects in biological signal processing, and seeking collaborators for methodological contribution.
- **Relevance:** Relevant to ML infrastructure and robustness challenges. While not directly about LLMs or agents, addresses fundamental ML generalization issues relevant to building robust AI systems.
