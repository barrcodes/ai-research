## CRAFT: Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning

- **URL:** https://huggingface.co/blog/flymy-ai/craft-1
- **Published:** 2026-02-05
- **Description:** CRAFT is a method that adds reasoning and iterative refinement loops to text-to-image generation without requiring model retraining. It decomposes prompts into explicit visual constraints, verifies outputs using a vision-language model (VLM), and iteratively refines failing constraints through prompt or image editing.
- **Relevance:** Demonstrates classic agentic patterns including reasoning loops, feedback-based verification using VLMs as judges, iterative refinement based on constraint satisfaction, and multi-model tool use. Exemplifies the sense-plan-act-verify-refine agent architecture applied to multimodal workflows.
