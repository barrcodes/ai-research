Gemini 3.1 Pro dominates: 77.1% ARC-AGI-2 and 80.6% SWE-Bench with adjustable inference-time reasoning depth—compute scaling at inference is now the primary frontier lever, not training. Stripe's Minions architecture merges 1,300+ PRs/week via hybrid blueprint orchestration; a separate project encodes a 35,000-line multi-agent system as a 1,398-line portable markdown specification. Claude Code 2.1.49 ships git worktree isolation for parallel agent streams; community observability tool claude-devtools reaches 700+ stars and #3 on HN within days. Sonnet 4.6 outperforms Opus on breadth-first PR review at 1.6–5.5x lower cost—task-specific model routing replaces tier-based defaults. Taalas silicon-native inference delivers 17k tok/s at 20x lower hardware cost; CDLM achieves 14x latency reduction through diffusion-based inference. Pharmaceutical hallucination benchmarks expose domain-specific frontier failures: Opus 4.6 at 63.8% vs Kimi K2.5 at 34.8%—domain evaluation is now a production requirement. 20 articles researched across 9 themes.

### [2026-02-19](./2026-02-19/index.md)

Agent autonomy research inverts assumptions: Anthropic data shows users increase monitoring as trust grows rather than relaxing oversight—design for continuous intervention capability. Enterprise agent failures mapped: IBM's MAST taxonomy reveals model-class-specific vulnerabilities (frontier models fail isolated, open-source cascades) with verification as frontier weakness. Step 3.5 Flash achieves frontier reasoning (AIME 97.3%) with sparse MoE architecture deployable on consumer hardware—selective computation beats dense scaling. Multi-agent orchestration matures: Broodlink standardizes MCP/A2A patterns with semantic memory; Forge inverts agent autonomy with deterministic checkpoints treating AI as subroutine. EVMbench reveals security asymmetry: 70% exploitation rate but weak patching—plan for human review of AI-proposed fixes. Anthropic enforces hard OAuth/API separation with unilateral enforcement. Multilingual safety gap exposed: 36-53% guardrail variance by language invalidates English-only safety validation. 12 articles researched across 6 themes.

### [2026-02-18](./2026-02-18/index.md)

Model economics inflection: Claude Sonnet 4.6 achieves 59% developer preference over Opus 4.5 at 5x lower cost, reshaping production routing strategies from Opus-first to Sonnet-default. Open-source models (GLM-5, Qwen3.5) close frontier gaps with permissive licensing—geopolitical shift as Chinese models achieve US-level performance trained on non-US hardware. Agentic infrastructure matures: Programmatic tool calling (37% token savings), dynamic web filtering (11% accuracy gains), multi-agent debate patterns, and safety infrastructure (SentinelGate, Satgate-proxy) enable production-grade agent deployment. Specialization outperforms scale: Grok 4.20's four-agent debate architecture and DeepMind's domain-specific systems demonstrate verification-driven reliability beats monolithic scaling. Government & regulatory capture: FedRAMP certification, $20M regulation investment, Pentagon drone orchestration contracts embed AI policy into procurement and technical architecture. Developer role transformation: 70-90% AI code generation shifts engineers from authors to architects; entry-level roles face disruption while architectural experience becomes highest-value skill. 35 articles researched across 8 themes.

### [2026-02-17](./2026-02-17/index.md)

Attention mechanism fragmentation: Qwen3.5's hybrid linear-full attention shows scaffolding strategy (prompt engineering, context management) drives 9-point agentic gains over pure architectural choices. Parameter efficiency displaces scaling: MiniCPM-o 4.5 (9B) matches Gemini 2.5 Flash via architecture innovation; TinyAya (3.35B) achieves multilingual SOTA through tokenization rather than compute; FunctionGemma 270M reaches 90-97% tool-calling accuracy via targeted fine-tuning. Multi-agent verification emerges as hallucination solution: Grok 4.20's 4-agent peer review (12.11% trading returns vs. all competitors losing) proves disagreement-driven validation outperforms single-model chains. DeepMind's delegation framework identifies MCP policy layer gap; contract-first protocols with cryptographic enforcement replace heuristic orchestration. Memory architecture becomes requirement: Project Orchestrator's Neo4j + MCP + semantic search addresses statelessness at scale; Claude-engram's salience-decay-consolidation model outperforms append-only logs. Security governance decouples from capabilities: Rulebricks policy engine and OpenAI Lockdown Mode enable autonomy + auditability through external policy layers. Pentagon-Anthropic dispute (July 11 deadline) may fragment AI ecosystem via supply chain risk designation. Genuine scientific contribution validated: GPT-5.2 derived novel gluon scattering formula (compression → pattern recognition → proof workflow). Remote Labor Index reveals 3.75% success rate ceiling—current agents bottlenecked by planning/error-recovery architecture, not raw reasoning. Regional optimization becomes moat: Anthropic's India deployment (second-largest revenue), TinyAya variants, MiniCPM-o training prioritize localization over English-dominant scaling. 11 sources, 21 articles researched.
