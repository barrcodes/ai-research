## Building for an audience of one: starting and finishing side projects with AI

- **URL:** https://codemade.net/blog/building-for-one/
- **Published:** 2026-02-16
- **Description:** Explores how AI tools enable developers to complete niche side projects that might otherwise remain unfinished. The author demonstrates using Claude to build FastTab, a custom task switcher for KDE Plasma, despite having no prior experience with Zig or X11 programming.
- **Relevance:** Directly discusses using Claude as a coding assistant for real-world project development, demonstrating practical AI-assisted development patterns.

## PageMap – MCP server that compresses web pages from 100K to 2-5K tokens

- **URL:** https://github.com/Retio-ai/Retio-pagemap
- **Published:** 2026-02-17
- **Description:** A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed for agentic systems and LLMs. Compresses web pages into structured maps of 2-5K tokens, enabling AI agents to efficiently read and interact with web content while using 97% fewer tokens than competing solutions.
- **Relevance:** Core agentic pattern implementation for Claude/Cursor with benchmark results showing 95.2% task success on e-commerce workflows. Directly addresses context window optimization for LLM agents.

## AI: Igniting the Spark to End Stagnation

- **URL:** https://lemire.me/blog/2026/02/15/ai-igniting-the-spark-to-end-stagnation/
- **Published:** 2026-02-15
- **Description:** Daniel Lemire argues that AI represents a crucial breakthrough to reverse economic stagnation, particularly in Canada. Discusses AI's impact on worker productivity, resource consumption concerns, and the democratization of opportunity for entrepreneurs and students.
- **Relevance:** Addresses broader AI capabilities and implications for productivity enhancement, relevant to understanding LLM adoption and impact.

## The left is missing out on AI

- **URL:** https://www.transformernews.ai/p/the-left-is-missing-out-on-ai-sanders-doctorow-bender-bores
- **Published:** 2026-02-16
- **Description:** Examines why progressive intellectuals have disengaged from AI discourse, dismissing it as "spicy autocomplete." Analyzes the contradiction of simultaneously claiming AI is both a job threat and incapable of replacing workers, and notes that Republicans use AI tools at higher rates than Democrats.
- **Relevance:** Discusses contemporary AI discourse, public perception of LLM capabilities, and practical adoption disparities between groups.
