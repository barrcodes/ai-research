## Overview

Boris Cherny, head of Claude Code at Anthropic, claims AI has effectively "solved" coding and predicts the software engineer job title will begin disappearing in 2026. At Anthropic, engineers generate 70-90% of code through Claude, with Cherny himself at 100% AI generation for two+ months. The shift redefines engineering roles from code authors to system architects, code reviewers, and cross-functional builders who handle specifications, user communication, and product decisions.

## Key Points

- **Code generation scale**: Anthropic achieves 90% of Claude's own codebase via AI, with 70-90% company-wide; Cherny ships 20+ pull requests daily, all AI-generated
- **Role transformation**: Engineers transition from writing code to managing AI agents, reviewing output, and making architectural decisions—Cherny estimates this shift at 70%+ of daily work
- **Productivity velocity**: Claude Code now chains 20+ autonomous actions before requiring human input (up from 10 six months ago), reducing friction on complex workflows
- **Job market disruption**: Traditional "software engineer" title predicted to fade; roles absorb tasks like writing specs, managing users, and domain-specific problem-solving
- **Hiring strategy shift**: Anthropic now recruits generalists over specialists, since traditional programming skills matter less when implementation is automated
- **Industry adoption lag**: Microsoft ~30% (April 2025), GitHub ~29% of Python functions AI-written; Anthropic is significantly ahead of industry baseline

## Technical Details

**Development velocity**: Cherny moves from code authorship to a creative orchestration role—designing what to build, then Claude handles tedious implementation. Code review becomes the primary quality gate.

**Agent autonomy progression**: Claude Code's action chaining improved from ~10 to ~20 autonomous steps, indicating advancing model capability to complete multi-step workflows with less human steering.

**Codebase self-generation**: Claude regenerates its own codebase at 90% AI-written rate, suggesting tight feedback loops where AI-generated code improves the model training its successors.

**Architecture-level work retained**: Engineers still decide *what* to build, system design, and trade-offs—AI handles *how* and implementation complexity.

## Implications

**For practitioners**: If coding is indeed "solved," the differentiator shifts to problem decomposition, architectural judgment, and communication skills. Senior engineers must evolve from code crafters to system thinkers and AI result validators. Your 15+ years of experience becomes most valuable in design decisions, not syntax.

**Career risk**: Entry-level roles as training grounds face disruption when 100% code generation is normalized. Existing engineers with architectural context survive; those whose value is purely syntactic implementation face commoditization.

**Team structure**: Product managers, designers, finance staff can generate their own code—breaking the specialist bottleneck but requiring new quality control and architectural coherence practices.

**When this matters**: If you're recruiting juniors, designing code review processes, or planning team skill development, assume code generation is table stakes. Invest in teaching problem decomposition, system design, and collaborative architecture work.

**Alternative view**: Dario Amodei (Anthropic CEO) reportedly sees full automation coming; Cherny frames engineers as "more important than ever." The honest take: the role transforms but doesn't vanish. What vanishes is code-writing *as the primary activity*.
