## [R] Shrinking a language detection model to under 10 KB
- **URL:** https://itnext.io/shrinking-a-language-detection-model-to-under-10-kb-b729bc25fd28?sk=0272ee69728b2cb9cd29218b411995d7
- **Published:** 2026-01-31
- **Description:** Research on optimizing and compressing a language detection model to a sub-10KB footprint. Demonstrates techniques for model miniaturization while maintaining performance.
- **Relevance:** Relevant to AI infrastructure and model optimization - shows practical approaches to deploying efficient models, important for embedded and edge AI applications.

## [P] I solved BipedalWalker-v3 (~310 score) with eigenvalues. The entire policy fits in this post.
- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/*/
- **Published:** 2026-01-30
- **Description:** A project demonstrating solving the BipedalWalker-v3 reinforcement learning environment using eigenvalue-based neural architecture with only 69 lines of Python code. Uses DC (difference of convex) functions for policy learning.
- **Relevance:** Relevant to agentic patterns and RL research - showcases novel neural network architectures and efficient policy learning for control tasks.

## [P] NotebookLM MCP + CLI v0.2.7 - Unified Package, File Uploads, Skill Installer, Multi-Profile Auth
- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/*/
- **Published:** 2026-01-31
- **Description:** Major update to NotebookLM MCP and CLI tool merging both packages into one. Adds file upload/download capabilities, skill installer for AI coding tools, and multi-profile authentication support.
- **Relevance:** Relevant to AI tools and Claude ecosystem - MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools expand AI assistant capabilities with file management and profile flexibility.

## [D] Recent Amazon L5 Applied Scientist coding questions
- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/*/
- **Published:** 2026-01-31
- **Description:** Discussion thread about interview questions for Amazon L5 Applied Scientist positions, including potential technical assessments on attention mechanisms and coding challenges.
- **Relevance:** Marginally relevant to LLM/AI tools - touches on transformer attention concepts in interview context but primarily focused on job preparation rather than AI advancements.

## [D] Free Tools Recommendations for Semantic Segmentation of Rice Fields
- **URL:** https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/*/
- **Published:** 2026-01-31
- **Description:** Discussion seeking recommendations for open-source semantic segmentation tools for agricultural applications (rice field detection). Mentions GIMP, CVAT, and labelme.
- **Relevance:** Marginally relevant to AI tools - focused on computer vision annotation rather than core LLM, agentic, or coding assistant topics.
