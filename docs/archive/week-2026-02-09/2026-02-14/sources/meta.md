## Summary

Scanned the Meta AI blog for articles published on or after 2026-02-07 matching the topic filter (LLM, agentic patterns, AI tools, Claude, GPT, coding assistants).

**Finding:** One article was published within the date range (February 9, 2026: "Reducing Government Costs and Increasing Access to Greenspaces in the United Kingdom with DINO"), but it focuses on computer vision applications rather than the specified AI topics. No relevant articles found matching the topic filter.

The recent blog posts from Meta are primarily focused on computer vision models (SAM, DINO, SAM 3D) and speech recognition, which fall outside the LLM/agentic/coding assistant scope of this research.
