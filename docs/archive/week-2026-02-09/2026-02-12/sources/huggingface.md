## DTS: A Candidate for the Best Parallel Reasoning in LLMs

- **URL:** https://huggingface.co/blog/guan-wang/llm-decoding-tree-sketching
- **Published:** 2026-02-11
- **Description:** Introduces Decoding Tree Sketching (DTS), a novel parallel reasoning algorithm for LLMs that detects decision tokens and branches only when semantically distinct continuations exist, improving efficiency over existing parallel reasoning methods.
- **Relevance:** Directly relevant to LLM capabilities and inference optimization. Presents novel reasoning architecture improvements with measurable performance gains (+20% on AIME, +12% on Live-Bench).
