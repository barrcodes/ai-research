## Overview

Version 3.0 of Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP) represents a strategic pivot from aspirational unilateral commitments to pragmatic acknowledgment of what single companies can achieve independently. The policy maintains its AI Safety Levels (ASL) framework while explicitly separating company-specific obligations from industry-wide recommendations, and replacing hard guarantees with transparent, externally-reviewed progress metrics.

## Key Points

- **Structural clarity**: Separates unilateral Anthropic commitments from industry recommendations, acknowledging "robust mitigations might prove impossible without collective action"
- **Capability ambiguity formalized**: Explicitly addresses scientific uncertainty in determining whether models have crossed safety thresholds (e.g., biological risk evidence remains "ambiguous")
- **External accountability strengthened**: Commits to safety reports every 3-6 months with third-party expert reviewers accessing unredacted materials
- **ASL-4 and ASL-5 remain undefined**: Reflects genuine uncertainty about future capability landscapes rather than false confidence
- **Frontier safety requires coordination**: Signals that safety at cutting-edge levels demands government and industry-wide standardization, not unilateral action

## Technical Details

The policy maintains the ASL framework (ASL-2 through ASL-5) but acknowledges critical implementation gaps:

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| ASL-2, ASL-3 definitions | Operational |
| ASL-4, ASL-5 definitions | Intentionally undefined |
| Biological risk thresholds | Scientifically ambiguous |
| Red-teaming capabilities | Now nonbinding targets with transparent grading |

Anthropic replaces hard commitments with a "Frontier Safety Roadmap" publishing nonbinding but publicly-declared targets, making progress traceable and credible rather than promising impossible mitigations.

## Implications

**For practitioners and architects**: This represents industry maturation on safety governance. Rather than viewing RSP v3 as weakened commitments, interpret it as honest acknowledgment that frontier AI safety requires multilateral coordination. Single-company safety theater (making promises you can't keep) is less valuable than transparent progress on solvable problems.

**For policy and procurement**: The framework has already influenced regulatory development (California SB 53, EU AI Act codes of practice). Organizations should expect future regulation to align with graduated ASL-based governance rather than binary safety thresholds.

**For competitive positioning**: Anthropic gains credibility by restructuring before reaching higher ASL levels, avoiding the trap of overcommitting. Competitors who maintain impossible promises risk losing trust when capability boundaries become ambiguous.
